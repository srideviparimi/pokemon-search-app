This application is used to search for the pokemons from an API.
It uses Javascript asynchronous functions while fetching the data from the API and displaying it in a Pokemon Card format.
To search we can use 
  a) Name of the Pokemon
  b) ID of the Pokemon(1 to 1025)
And displays all the information about the particular Pokemon.

Note: I have used the freeCodeCamp Pokemon API to fetch the data.
